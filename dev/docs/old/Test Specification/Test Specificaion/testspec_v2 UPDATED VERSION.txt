\section{INTRODUCTION}

\subsection{Purpose of this Document}
This document describes system tests to be performed on complete JoggleCube system. It should be read in the context of the
Group Project, taking into account the JoggleCube Requirements Specification\cite{SE.QA.CSRS}.
\subsection{Scope}
This document covers test procedures used for exercising the system. It describes tests that need to 
be conducted for each of the functional requirements listed in JoggleCube Requirements Specification\cite{SE.QA.CSRS}.

\subsection{Objectives}
This document aims to specify in detail how each of system tests will be executed by identifying:
\begin{itemize}
	\item purpose of the test
	\item initial conditions \( input\)
	\item expected output from the system
	\item criteria for passing the test
\end{itemize}
