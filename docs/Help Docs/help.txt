What is Jogglecube?

Jogglecube is a 3d word-finding game. The goal is to find the most, and most high scoring words on the cube, before time runs out!

How to select a word:
1) Click the first letter of the word on the grid
2) Click on the second letter of the word, which will be on an adjacent square in the cube.
3) Continue clicking on letters adjacent to the last selected, until the word is complete. 
4) Click submit, and add that words's points will be added to your total - IF the word is in the dictionary 

Different letters have different values: so the longest word you can find on a grid isn't always the highest scoring!
